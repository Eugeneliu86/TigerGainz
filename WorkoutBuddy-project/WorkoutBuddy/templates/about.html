    <h2 class="lead2"><strong>Why Was TigerGainz Created?</strong></h2>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and virtual classes, Vinay Konuru ’24 and I (Ben Cai ’24) had to find new ways
        to stay active. Unfortunately, each of our peers had different schedules, goals, exercise preferences, and
        so on; quarantine only exacerbated these conflicts. As a result, Vinay and I had to exercise on our own, and
        we struggled to keep ourselves motivated. Fortunately, Vinay and I met each other and other workout-eager
        classmates in the Class of 2024 Princeton group chat. After much planning, we were able to find suitable
        workout buddies and schedules that allowed us to meet our exercise goals and get to bond with our (new)
        peers.

    <p>That’s why Vinay and I, with the help of Eugene Liu ’24 and Elizabeth Medina ’24, co-founded TigerGainz to
        share the joy of exercise with the rest of the Princeton community.

    <p>Knowing that working out with others helps increase accountability and performance—<a class="links"

            have found that
            having a buddy can increase your workout time and intensity by as much as 200 percent</a>—we hope
        TigerGainz
        will not only help Princetonians find the most fitting workout partners/groups, but it will help create a
        closer community on- and off-campus.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, TigerGainz is a way to empower and connect Princetonians, and we wish all of you the best of
        luck.

    <p>Happy Exercising!</p>

    <p class="lead2"><strong>Below are answers to FAQs. If you still have questions or concerns, <a class="links-white"
                href="#">please email
                one of the co-founders or complete our feedback form.</a></strong></p>

    <p class="lead3"><strong>1. Who has access to my TigerGainz responses/workout preferences? What is my data
            used
            for? </strong></p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>All your TigerGainz responses/workout preferences and profile are securely stored and only available to Princeton
        students that have logged in with their Princeton gmail. Your prospective matches will see your profile and any
        Princeton student can see your workout profile in our directory even if they aren’t a match. The data is solely
        used to create workout buddy matches and is not shared with any other organizations.
    </p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p class="lead2"><strong>2. My current Princeton workout buddy/group and I decided that we are not the best fit for
            each other/Someone chose me as their workout buddy but they are not one of my matches and/or I am not sure
            if I want to be their workout buddy. Can we request new Princeton workout buddies/groups? If so, how?
        </strong></p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>Although it can be awkward, sometimes the TigerGainz matches don’t work out but that’s okay! If you would still
        like to search for workout buddies (or groups), politely tell the person who chose you as their partner you
        situation (they should be understanding!).
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, <b>both</b> of you should request new Princeton workout buddies/groups. Simply go onto the home page and
        click
        the sign up button to <b>complete the form again</b> (note: this will replace your old reponses). TigerGainz
        will find
        new matches for you again, and then you can choose who to reach out to.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, the algorithm takes both people off the database when only one person “Accepts” a match; this will be
        resolved in the future. Additionally an option to decline a match offer from another Princetonian will be
        implemented.
    </p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p class="lead3"><strong>3. Can I edit my workout preferences? If so, how? </strong></p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>Yes, you can edit your workout preferences. To do this, please go to the Database section and click the ““Take me
        off the database please” button. Then, click the sign up button to complete the form again (note: this will
        replace your old responses). However, this also means you may get different matches.
    </p>
    <p>If you would like to keep the same matches but want to indicate different workout preferences, please PERSONALLY
        reach out to those matches (via your own email; not TigerGainz) and inform them of your new workout preference;
        you can find their contact info under their profile. Please do NOT “Accept” a match via TigerGainz as this will
        remove the other person from the database even though they have not been paired with someone who has the same
        workout preferences. Hopefully, you can still work something out!
    </p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p class="lead2"><strong>4. Why am I getting no matches on my initial search? What should I do? How long will I have
            to wait for a match?
        </strong></p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>In the unlikely scenario that TigerGainz finds no suitable matches upon form submission - most likely due to
        uncommon workout preferences (e.g. specific days or workout lengths that not many other Princetonians are
        looking for) - you should consider adjusting your workout preferences and resubmitting the form. Being more
        flexible will likely result in more matches; plus, it’s a great way to meet different people.
    </p>
    <p>To resubmit your form, please go to the Database section and click the “Take me off the database please” button.
        Then, click the sign up button to complete the form again (note: this will replace your old responses).
        Hopefully, if there are still Princetonians looking for a workout buddy or group, you should instantly get
        matches.
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, if you have already submitted the form and are still not getting matches, that means someone
        hasn’t chosen you to be their workout buddy or group yet.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is especially common as the semester progresses where you might have to wait several days since many people
        will have presumably found matches and taken themself off our database. At the beginning of each semester when
        everyone is signing up, the match time is less than a day if not instantaneous.
    </p>
    <p>
        In any case, if you don’t want to wait for someone to choose you, please resubmit your form (see above) or check
        out the TigerGainz directory.
    </p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p class="lead3"><strong>5. I haven’t heard back from TigerGainz in a while and I’m still looking for a
            match.
            What should I do?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>If you are still looking for a match and TigerGainz has not reached out to you, that probably means that someone
        hasn’t chosen you as their workout partner.</p>
    <p>As such, you should consider resubmitting the workout form. To do this, please go to the Database section and
        click the ““Take me off the database please” button. Then, click the sign up button to complete the form again
        (note: this will replace your old responses).
    </p>
    <p>Hopefully, if there are still Princetonians looking for a workout buddy or group, you should instantly get
        matches. Alternatively, you can check out the TigerGainz directory.
    </p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p class="lead2"><strong>6. How can I maximize my chances of getting a match?
        </strong></p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>To maximize your chances of getting a match, you should select as many workout preferences you are
        comfortable with and choose the “average” response when applicable. For example, in terms of
        availability,
        if you are free more days, you will have more options. On the other hand, for preferences like workout
        length, you should select a more common option like “1 hour” as opposed to “2 hours.” In any case, being
        flexible will grant you the most matches. </p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p class="lead3"><strong>7. Am I able to view other people’s profiles even if I haven’t matched with them?
        </strong></p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>Yes, anyone who has logged in with a Princeton email can view your profile via the TigerGainz directory
        even
        if they aren’t a match or haven’t signed up for TigerGainz. As such, please be mindful of what you
        write.
