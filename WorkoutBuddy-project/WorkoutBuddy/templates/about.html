    <h2 class="lead2"><strong>Why Was TigerGainz Created?</strong></h2>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and virtual classes, Vinay Konuru ’24 and I (Ben Cai ’24) had to find new ways
        to stay active. Unfortunately, each of our peers had different schedules, goals, exercise preferences, and
        so on; quarantine only exacerbated these conflicts. As a result, Vinay and I had to exercise on our own, and
        we struggled to keep ourselves motivated. Fortunately, Vinay and I met each other and other workout-eager
        classmates in the Class of 2024 Princeton group chat. After much planning, we were able to find suitable
        workout buddies and schedules that allowed us to meet our exercise goals and get to bond with our (new)
        peers.

    <p>That’s why Vinay and I, with the help of Eugene Liu ’24 and Elizabeth Medina ’24, co-founded TigerGainz to
        share the joy of exercise with the rest of the Princeton community.

    <p>Knowing that working out with others helps increase accountability and performance—<a class="links"

            have found that
            having a buddy can increase your workout time and intensity by as much as 200 percent</a>—we hope
        TigerGainz
        will not only help Princetonians find the most fitting workout partners/groups, but it will help create a
        closer community on- and off-campus.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, TigerGainz is a way to empower and connect Princetonians, and we wish all of you the best of
        luck.

    <p>Happy Exercising!</p>

    <p class="lead2"><strong>Below are answers to FAQs. If you still have questions or concerns, <a
                class="links-white" href="#">please email
                one of the co-founders or complete our feedback form.</a></strong></p>

    <h2 class="lead3"><strong>1. Who has access to my TigerGainz responses/workout preferences? What is my data
            used
            for? </strong></h2>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>All your TigerGainz responses/workout preferences and profile are securely stored and only available to
        Princeton students that have signed up for TigerGainz. Your prospective matches will see your profile
        and
        any Princeton student that has signed up for TigerGainz can see your workout profile in our directory
        even
        if they aren’t a match. The data is solely used to create workout buddy matches and is not shared with
        any
        other organizations.

    <h2 class="lead2"><strong>2. My current Princeton workout buddy/group and I decided that we are not the best
            fit
            for each other. Can we request new Princeton workout buddies/groups? If so, how?
        </strong></h2>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>Yes, you can request new Princeton workout buddies/groups. Simply go onto the home page and click the
        sign up
        button to complete the form again (note: this will replace your old reponses). TigerGainz will find new
        matches for you again, and then you can choose who to reach out to.
    </p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <h2 class="lead3"><strong>3. Can I edit my workout preferences? If so, how? </strong></h2>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>Yes, you can edit your workout preferences. Simply go onto the home page and click the sign up button to
        complete the form again. Your new responses will replace your old ones. However, this also means you may
        get
        different matches.
    </p>
    <p>If you would like to keep the same matches but want to indicate different workout preferences, just reach
        out to those matches and inform them of your new workout preferences. Hopefully, you can still work
        something
        out!
    </p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <h2 class="lead2"><strong>4. Why am I getting no matches? How long will I have to wait for a match?
        </strong></h2>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>In the unlikely scenario that TigerGainz finds no suitable matches - most likely due to uncommon workout
        preferences (e.g. specific days or workout lengths that not many other Princetonians are looking for) -
        you
        should consider adjusting your workout preferences. Being more flexible will likely result in more
        matches;
        plus, it’s a great way to meet different people.
    </p>
    <p>To do this, please go onto the home page and click the sign up button to complete the form again (note:
        this
        will replace your old responses). Hopefully, if there are still Princetonians looking for a workout
        buddy or
        group, you should instantly get matches.
    </p>
    <p>Regarding the wait time for matches: typically, at the beginning of each semester when everyone is
        signing
        up, it is less than a day if not instantaneous. As the semester progresses though, you may have to wait
        several days since many people will have presumably found matches and taken themself off our database.

    <h2 class="lead3"><strong>5. I haven’t heard back from TigerGainz in a while and I’m still looking for a
            match.
            What should I do?
        </strong>
    </h2>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>If you are still looking for a match and TigerGainz has not reached out to you, that probably means that
        there are either no closely suitable Princetonians or no Princetonians looking for matches at all. The
        latter reason is highly unlikely though.</p>
    <p>In any case, you should consider adjusting your workout preferences. Being more flexible will likely
        result
        in more matches; plus, it’s a great way to meet different people.
    </p>
    <p>To do this, please go onto the home page and click the sign up button to complete the form again (note:
        this
        will replace your old responses). Hopefully, if there are still Princetonians looking for a workout
        buddy or
        group, you should instantly get matches.

    <hr class="my-4">
    <h2 class="lead2"><strong>6. How can I maximize my chances of getting a match?
        </strong></h2>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>To maximize your chances of getting a match, you should select as many workout preferences you are
        comfortable with and choose the “average” response when applicable. For example, in terms of
        availability,
        if you are free more days, you will have more options. On the other hand, for preferences like workout
        length, you should select a more common option like “1 hour” as opposed to “2 hours.” In any case, being
        flexible will grant you the most matches. </p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <h2 class="lead3"><strong>7. Am I able to view other people’s profiles even if I haven’t matched with them?
        </strong></h2>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>Yes, anyone who has logged in with a Princeton email can view your profile via the TigerGainz directory
        even
        if they aren’t a match or haven’t signed up for TigerGainz. As such, please be mindful of what you
        write.
