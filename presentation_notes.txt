TigerGainz Princeton's Workout Buddy and Group Matchmaker

So as Professor Danver put it, What's the Ow?


Many of us experienced just how hard it is to stay consistent in our workout plans during quarantine. Motivation tends to dip to an all time low when you’re constantly worrying about keeping yourself accountable. A great solution to this has always been to find a workout buddy. But as we went into lockdown, most of us didn’t have anyone to workout with. 

As you can see in these polls, many people feel similarly.

The only way to find someone with similar goals is making a post in massive group chats and hoping someone responds. Not only can this be uncomfortable for some, it is also ineffective. 


I myself experienced this when trying to find a friend to workout with, luckily having Yash, the guy in the previous slide, say that he was interested days later. So what’s the solution to this?
